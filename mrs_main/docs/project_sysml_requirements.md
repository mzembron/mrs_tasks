### Requirements the mrs_tasks project should aim to fulfill
(to be moved to SysML requirements diagram)


#### Requirements:
- task allocation to a robot able to execute the task,
- all robots should be aligned with the plan of task execution (and allocation of tasks),
- ability to maintain the operations on the failure of any node (not all at once),
- optimization of execution time (with proper allocation), to be more specific: the output plan should not take more than approach with all tasks scheduled for one universal robot,
- provide updates on advancements in task execution,
- schedule actions (tasks) of specific robot (plan its future actions),
- possibility to include into a system robot of different natures (heterogenic)
